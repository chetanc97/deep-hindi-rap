Following this amazing blog post by  [Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) m this is a deep learning rap model which attempts to rap like a Hinid rapper .Models are trained to understand about text  - we input the model with a short series of words/characters from real rap lyrics.
The current network uses Bidirectional LSTM units .

### Future work 
*To make this model better using lecical stress and simple heuristic programming and feed the output as input to the same model .
*Increase data corpus to a large one .

### Credits for Poems 
All credits for refering sample poems for building model which raps .
